# Charles University, Faculty of Law, Thesis Word Template
Since the official template is not usable, I have decided to make my own version of it that would be as close as possible to the original one.

I have made it primarily for Rigorosum thesis, but it can also be used for the Bachelor's and Master's ones. You just have to change some of the fields; there should be drop-down lists for them. The original templates can be found [on the official website](https://knihovna.prf.cuni.cz/kvalifikacni-prace/sablony-vs-praci).

Please, do not reupload the template. Link this repository instead. I suppose I will be updating it, so let's all have the latest version.

Since it is a Word template and it not possible to check the code, do not make pull requests. Open issues instead if you find any.

There will be two files – docx and dotx. Use preferably dotx.

BTW, you can use my Zotero style for full-note ISO-690 that is available [in the official repository](https://www.zotero.org/styles?q=id%3Aiso690-full-note-cs) (on GitHub [here](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles/blob/master/iso690-full-note-cs.csl)) if you want to automate the citations. (Excluding the cases and legislation, unfortunately.) Then, you will have to change the "Seznam použité literatury", "Seznam použitých internetových zdrojů" and "Seznam použitých ostatních zdrojů" headings to something like "Seznam použité literatury a internetových zdrojů" and have the citations altogether. Zotero does not support the categorization of the sources by the item types since it is quite useless.
